# Vectora

Vectora is a simple SVG editor built with React and Redux. Users can use mouse movement to create basic SVG shapes
and select fill and border colors with a color picker. Current supported shapes are rectangles, circles, ellipses, and paths.
All shapes can be repositioned by selecting them and dragging them to the new desired location. Shapes can be resized by
selecting them and dragging one of the 8 nodes that appear as part of their bounding box.
